# How to Reproduce the Error

1. Set a breakpoint in my.test.ts using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

2. In the debug terminal, execute the command yarn test.

3. Observe that the breakpoint is not functioning as expected.

# What I expected:

I anticipated that the breakpoint would pause the execution of the code at that specific line. However, it appears that the test is not even running.
